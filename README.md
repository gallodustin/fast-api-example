# fast-api-example
 This is a simple example of a REST API using Python, FastAPI, Postgres, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, and Docker. The API is a basic social media app that allows users to create, read, update, delete, and vote on posts. There is also a user database to store users and authenticate/authorize those users' access to posts. This was created following the wonderful free(!) course here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA
 Thanks to freeCodeCamp.org for the awesome course, I recommend it.
